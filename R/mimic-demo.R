#' MIMIC-III Critical Care Database
#'
#' MIMIC-III (**M**edical **I**nformation **M**art for **I**ntensive **C**are
#' III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified
#' health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed
#' in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between
#' 2001 and 2012.
#'
#' The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign
#' measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test
#' results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and
#' mortality (both in and out of hospital).
#'
#' MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology,
#' clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is
#' notable for three factors:
#'
#' - it is freely available to researchers worldwide
#' - it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients
#' - it contains high temporal resolution data including lab results,
#'   electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms.
